Project Title: Library Management SystemDescriptionThis project implements a Library Management System using MySQL. 

It provides a relational database structure to manage library resources, including books, authors, categories, members, loans, and reservations. This system enables efficient tracking of book inventory, member information, and borrowing activities. How to Run/Setup the ProjectTo set up the database, follow these steps:Install MySQL: Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system.Create a Database:Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, Command Line). Execute the following SQL command to create a new database:CREATE DATABASE LibraryManagementSystem; 

Use the database:USE LibraryManagementSystem;

Import the SQL Schema:Execute the SQL script provided in the library_management_system_sql.sql file. This will create the tables and define the relationships.If using the command line, you can use the following command:mysql -u your_username -p LibraryManagementSystem < library_management_system_sql.sql

Replace your_username with your MySQL username.  You will be prompted for your password.Database Schema (ERD Description)The database schema consists of the following tables:Books: Stores book information (BookID, Title, ISBN, PublicationYear, AuthorID, CategoryID, TotalCopies, AvailableCopies).Authors: Stores author information (AuthorID, Name, Biography).Categories: Stores book categories (CategoryID, Name).Members: Stores member information (MemberID, Name, Address, Phone, Email, DateOfBirth).Loans: Stores loan information (LoanID, MemberID, BookID, LoanDate, ReturnDate, Status).Reservations: Stores reservation information (ReservationID, MemberID, BookID, ReservationDate, Status).Relationships:A book has one author (One-to-Many from Authors to Books).A book belongs to one category (One-to-Many from Categories to Books).A member can borrow many books (One-to-Many from Members to Loans).A member can reserve many books (One-to-Many from Members to Reservations).A book can be borrowed many times (One-to-Many from Books to Loans).A book can be reserved many times (One-to-Many from Books to Reservations).The Loans and Reservations tables serve as linking tables to manage the relationships between Members and Books.
